# lore
Quick, hacked prototype of coposable context functions.

It is untested, unstable, probably bugged, but it works...

... at least for simple cases.

## Running

Use [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/)


```bash
scala-cli .
```
will run the `playground.scala` file.

```bash
scala-cli compile . --server=false
```
will allow advanced debugging.
